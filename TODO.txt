-Right now when we load from the database we return 0 in AddSnapshot.doTopSnapshotToCV() if the number of children is less than 26.

-Change the way hot video syncs work so that only hot videos in the recent week get added.
-List item thumbnails need to have dynamic Content descriptions (equivalent to their video titles).
