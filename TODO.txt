Atakr TODO (Long Term):
-Entire game feature
	-make it so that game is attached the video object being stored
	-create a list of recognized games
	-give games images
-Right now when we load from the database we return 0 in AddSnapshot.doTopSnapshotToCV() if the number of children is less than 26. We need to figure out a way to incorporate handling this into infinite scrolling. It's a problem to do when infinite scrolling is added. Infinite scrolling TODO link is https://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView
-Change the way hot video syncs work so that only hot videos in the recent week get added.
-List item thumbnails need to have dynamic Content descriptions (equivalent to their video titles).
-Fix text style of share activity (in regards to ellipses, copy list_normal_style)
-Add user functionality (user image, user page, likes and comments).


IMMEDIATE TODO (FOR APP LAUNCH):
-Fix infinite scrolling for Hot tab (might need to update views functionality and popularity functionality first)
-Add icons to the tabs
-Change the banner
-Replace all instances of the user icon with the Atakr logo, so that the user feature can be implemented in full at a later date.
-Create a search function.
-Implement views and popularity.
-Use Atakr title.
-clean up code.
-add video categories
